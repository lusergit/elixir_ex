* Basics
  Start the server with
  #+BEGIN_SRC elixir
    pid = Minis.start()
  #+END_SRC

  Sending =:inc= increments the counter, while =:dec= decrements it:

  #+BEGIN_SRC elixir
    pid = Minis.start()		# Counter = 0
    send(pid, :inc)			# Counter = 1
    send(pid, :dec)			# Counter = 0
  #+END_SRC

  =:get= to get back the current value

  #+BEGIN_SRC elixir
    pid = Minis.start()

    send(pid, :inc)
    send(pid, {:get, self()})	# send the current counter to `self()`
    
    res = receive do
      {:ok, counter} -> counter = 1
      _ -> :error
    end

    # res should be `true`
  #+END_SRC

* Test
  Three tests are included in the [[file:test/][test]] folder. You can run them with
  
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    mix test
  #+END_SRC
