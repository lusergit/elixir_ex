* Basics
  Start the server with
  #+BEGIN_SRC elixir
    pid = Ecounter.start()
  #+END_SRC

  Send the event name to increment its counter, or start it (setting
  it to 0) if it was never recorded

  #+BEGIN_SRC elixir
    pid = Ecounter.start()

    send(pid, {:event, "Event one"}) # Event one now at 0

    send(pid, {:event, "Event one"}) # Event one now at 1
  #+END_SRC

  Get the event counter with ={:fetch, where_to_send, event}=

  #+BEGIN_SRC elixir
    pid = Ecounter.start()
    event_name = "Event one"

    send(pid, {:event, event_name}) # 0
    send(pid, {:event, event_name}) # 1

    send(pid, {:fetch, self(), event_name})

    receive do
      {:events_count, {:error, :event_not_found}} -> IO.puts("Error while retrieving event #{event_name}")
      {:events_count, n} -> IO.puts("Event #{event_name} counter at #{n}")
    end
  #+END_SRC

* Test
  Tests are included in the [[file:test/][test]] folder. You can run them with
  
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    mix test
  #+END_SRC
